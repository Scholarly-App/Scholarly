# Scholarly: AI Driven Smart Learning Assistant

## 📘 Project Description

In the modern educational era, students often struggle to maintain focus whilst watching long video lectures or learning via a textbook. The main problem here is retaining focus while studying.

**Scholarly** aims to solve this problem by developing an innovative educational app to revolutionize how students comprehend and interact with learning-based content.

Scholarly enables students to upload a book and automatically generate a personalized learning roadmap based on their uploaded content. The generated roadmap will act as a study plan and will allow students to track their progress as they move forward.

For each topic in the roadmap, the app will provide both detailed and summarized explanations, ensuring an efficient and effective learning experience. Additionally, students will be able to generate short educational videos (reels) for their selected topics. The main objective of these reels will be to make complex topics easier to understand and learn them with great speed and accuracy, without losing focus.

Furthermore, the app also features MCQ-based quiz generation, allowing students to assess their knowledge and understanding of each selected topic.

The core objective of this project is to solve students’ issue of losing focus whilst studying by combining traditional study methods with cutting-edge AI technology, making education more interactive, personalized, and efficient.
