Scholarly; AI Driven Smart Learning Assistant

### Scope
The project aims to develop an innovative educational app designed to revolutionize how students interact with and comprehend learning-based content. The app allows users to upload material and automatically generates a diverse range of assessments, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs), fill-in-the-blank exercises, and true/false questions. These assessments are designed to reinforce learning and provide immediate feedback. The app also features an intelligent grading system that evaluates student performance, highlights incorrect answers, and offers correct answers with detailed explanations, available in both AI-generated videos and summarized text formats. Additionally, the app is equipped with a feature that generates personalized learning roadmaps based on the uploaded content, supplemented by short, instructional videos to guide students through the material effectively. This project aims to enhance the learning experience by combining traditional study methods with cutting-edge AI technology, making education more interactive, personalized, and efficient.
